Walkthrough:

The game has sound effects and pictures, so I recommend you turn on sound or use headphones to enjoy it. All picture and sound files are stored in the source folder "pics" of folder "O1_AdvGame". The game runs fine on my laptop, but there might be error when running on other computers due to duplicate file names. In that case, please contact me through my Telegram @tieubinh03, I will re-send the version of different name (if I may).All commands work, but this walkthrough only includes key commands that have significance on the game results. To see all other commands, please look at the file moreInstruction.txt

(1): tomorrow
(2): lawsuit
(3): name
(4): brain
(5): promise
(6): you will die 
-> Explain: Notice the names of all the rooms that are titled on the top floor, when put together, they form a message: 'you will die' (you can enter capital letters as well).
(7): 4 
You can use scanner to spot exactly where the bomb rooms are. Notice that 1/3 of maximum danger level indicates that bomb rooms are 2 rooms away from you on the specific direction according to the scanner; 2/3 of maximum danger level indicates that bomb rooms are just 1 room away and maximum danger level indicates the room right next to you is the bomb room.

(*): the reason that you need to enter room B7 (final bomb room) from room B8 is because the answer for the question from the 'first paper' is the 'letter E'. On the map, this stands for 'East', meaning that you need to enter room B7 from the room that is on its East side: room B8.

>>> Instruction:   *** The game has sound effects and pictures, so I recommend you turn on sound or use headphones to enjoy it. All picture and sound files are stored in the source folder "pics" of folder "O1_AdvGame". The game runs fine on my laptop, but there might be error when running on other computers due to duplicate file names. In that case, please contact me through my Telegram @tieubinh03, I will re-send the version of different name (if I may).   *** The 3Dmap.png file does not have the name of each area in it for the sake of the game. You will know why once you reach to that phase of the game.   *** About the areas:   # The game world consists of 32 areas divided equally into 2 floors, which means there is a total of 6 directions: north, east, south, west, up, down. (please look at file "3Dmap.png" to visualize this game world more easily)       # Each area is considered a room.      # There is an item called "map" that helps you locate which room you are in in the game world (more on that later).      # You will start on the top floor in the corner room. Your first job is to try to find a room from which you can go down to the bottom floor. But it's not just about finding, there are rooms that contain automatic bombs, if you enter those rooms, the bombs will explode, and you will lose.      # There is also an item called "scanner" that detects bomb radiation to helps you avoid the bomb rooms (more on that later).      # Moreover, between some rooms are locked doors and you cannot go through unless you have the suitable key for that door. In order to obtain the keys, you need to answer correctly to Riddler's brainteasers. Those questions can be revealed by using the item called "riddler's box" that you can find in some particular rooms (more on that later).      # After you've gone through all the questions and found the room that has the "down" direction, reach to the bottom floor.      # On the bottom floor, your job is not to avoid the bomb room but find one instead. Again, you can do this by using the "scanner" to detect the radiation emit from the room. (the bottom floor has only 1 bomb room)      # However, once you find the room, you have to enter the room from the exact direction that the hint from an item "first paper" tells you. If you are already in that room, you can still go out if you want. But unless you have deactivated the bomb, you have to enter the room from the exact direction as the paper says.       # In that room, you will have to 'enter' a number that can deactivate the bomb (more on the method 'enter' and that number later).      # Once you successfully deactivate the bomb, only one final job to do is to find where Riddler hides and go there to catch the Riddler. Hint for this will be reveal in the game. If you need, it is under one of the corner rooms. Yes, turns out, there are 3 floors actually.       *** About the commands:   # Old commands from Adventure:   - get itemName    : pick up item   - drop itemName   : drop item   - examine itemName: invest the item   - belt            : show what you are carrying   - go direction    : go to a new room in the direction   - rest            : basically do nothing and rest, though you will be complained by Alfred.    - quit            : quit the game      # New added commands:
   - help            : print story and instruction
   - use item        : use the item particular function. Each item's function will be discussed later (this is the function you will have to use a lot)        - ask someone     : you can ask either Alfred or Lucius for hint whenever you encounter difficult question (for example, type: 'ask alfred' and you will know what Alfred is thinking about the question you are having. You can only have one question at a time so there is no need to specify)                          - answer ...      : used to answer to a question you are having from the riddler's box. For example, when you pick up some riddler's box, and read the question and think the answer is 'abc', type 'answer abc', and you will know the result. You can answer as many times as you need. There is no consequence.                          - enter ...       : this is only used to enter the number to deactivate the bomb in the final bomb room on the bottom floor. It can only be used when you are in the final bomb room, if you use it outside, you will be complained by Alfred. If you think the right number is 8, for example, type 'enter 8'. Different from the 'answer' command, when in the final bomb room, you can only enter once. If you enter the wrong number, the whole place explode and you lose.

   - look itemName   : check if some item is in the belt   *** About the items:
# All items are most meaningful with the 'use' command and should be used a lot, especially 'map' and 'scanner'. Of course, other commands works too, for example, 'examine'.
 - map: show you exactly where you are in the game world. Every time you go to a new room carrying this with you, when try ‘use map’, it will show you different position that you are at the moment.- scanner: show you bomb radiation detected from around you. Maximum radiation on some direction means that you are standing next to a bomb room on that direction. The closer you get to the bomb room, the higher the level of radiation detected. After you deactivate the bomb, the scanner still works as before since you just deactivate the bombs, not remove any of it. - riddler’s box: there are multiple of this on the first floor, and one on the bottom floor. These boxes contain keys that you need to unlock those locked doors preventing you from going one room to another.  - paper: there are two of these, namely ‘first paper’ and ‘second paper’. The first one contains hint for what to do next once you answer the riddler’s box on the bottom floor. The second one contains hint for the number that you need to enter once you are in the final bomb room. 

- key: used to open the locked doors, the keys are different from other items as you can use it by just using the 'go direction' command, no need to use it separately, but feel free to try.
